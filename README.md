# Gravity-Simulation

Originally a gravity simulator made with Python then ported to C++ finally reaches the web browser! This simulation is powered by a rust WebAssembly backend that uses a naive implementation where all the bodies have gravittional force on eachother. There are plans to use the Barnes-Hut algorithim utilizing quadtrees to improve performance but for now the naive implementation works. You can try out this beautiful mess [here](https://gravity.notaroomba.xyz) or browse around the repository.
